***[Projects](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#section_projects)*** (and skills documation with evidence)
- [Software](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_sftwr_trg)
  - [OpenGL](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_sftwr_opengl_trg)
    - (25) Twenty five example projects
    - Demonstrate moving from drawing a simple triangle to rendering a fully lighted scene, with:
      - Physics Based Rendering (PBR)
      - Irradiance Based Lighting (IBL)
      - Forward and deferred lighting
      - Particle systems
      - Signed distance field fonts (per Valve 2007)
      - Shadow mapping with directional, point source, and paraboloid shadow mapping.
    - Each has movies demonstrating the example project step with the accomplishments or features, in addition to downloads of a working EXE for Windows with resources (everything should be self contained and run in a minimal folder on a system with OpenGL)
  - [ShaderToy](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_sftwr_shadertoy_trg)
    - (2) Shaders demonstrating terrain erosion and reverse implementing the Unity skybox shader with modifications for dynamic sun, ground, and sky color along with pausing.
- [Math / Stats](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_math_trg) (mostly examples of hobby projects done for fun)
  - [Statistics of Star Trek](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_math_star_trek_stats_trg)
    - Set of 30+ charts discussion the Nielson ratings and user reviews (IMDB and TV.com) for Star Trek, with an emphasis on The Next Generation.
    - Looks at correlation of ratings to user reviews, along with character and setting appearances and how they individually or group rated with viewers.
    - Also shows director, teleplay writer, and story writer contributions and their individual averages, deviations, and total contributions.
  - [Statistics of Star Trek - DS9](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_math_star_trek_stats_ds9_trg)
    - Specifics about the show DS9 covered most of the ways I analyzed TNG, with updated methods based on some new ways of exploring the DS9 history with statistical graphing, grouping, and charting.
- [NASA](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_nasa_trg) (projects related to my prior work with NASA)
  - [ASMAT](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_nasa_asmat_trg) - Images, results, and video animations for CFD simulations of the Ares Scale Model Acoustic Test (ASMAT) at Marshall Space Flight Center Test Stand 116.
  - [Water Deluge](https://araesmojo-eng.github.io/index.html#prj_nasa_water_trg) - Orientation to the water deluge systems on NASA launch pads, with images, results, and video animations related to my work developing lagrangian particle methods for simulating 100,000 gallon per minute water deluge systems used with launch vehicles for vibration, heat, and blast wave suppression.
